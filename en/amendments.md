#### Amendments, compromises, shortcuts

Amendments are in the form of decision alternative. Amendments can be initiated the same way as a decision, designating the original decision process as target.

When there is a compromise based on more different decision alternatives, then a new decision alternative can be initiated with the compromise text and noting the original alternatives as compromise sources. In this case all of the issue representatives of the original proposal will be representatives with regards to the new proposal.

We deviate here from the debian resolution procedure by not allowing changes to a proposal text or withdrawal. This is to ensure that grassroots initiatives cannot be preempted by coercing the issue representative. In case of meaningful compromises it is expected that the original proposals will drop out as the issue bubbles up.

An elected representative can pick up proposals in discussion at lower level nodes to her node. In this case the elected representative picking up the proposal will be added to the issue representatives of the proposal. The reason for this rule is to make it possible to shorten the time needed for a discussion.
