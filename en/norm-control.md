### Norm control

Decisions contradicting higher level regulations are invalid. The judicial power of the node or a node above it \(in case the node does not have one, or there was an appeal\) is entitled to decide on validity. If there are questions raised about the validity of a decision, norm control can be asked proactively. Norm control can be initiated by any of the representatives of a node or its ancestor, the elected official for the auditory branch of the node or its ancestor, or based on a decision of a group in the subtree. 

Norm control is exercised by the judiciary branch, and the result can be

* nullifying a decision

* finding out that a need to legislate is not fulfilled

In case when a need to legislate is not fulfilled, the representatives of the node should initiate a decision to fulfill the need. If there is no procedure is initiated within 2\*D time, a new election is held.
