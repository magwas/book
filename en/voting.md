#### Voting

When the discussion period is over, the dummy alternative is added to the list of alternatives and the voting begins. The vote period is V (e.g. 14 days). Every individual in the subtree of the node have one vote, even if they are member of multiple groups.

Votes can be delegated to representatives in a liquid way: if the voter does not choose to vote, then her vote is counted as the vote of the delegate, otherwise her cast vote counts.

One can delegate to one representative in each of the ancestor nodes, and one issue representative in each of the issues. Delegation can be withdrawn at any time.

When someone delegates to multiple representatives, the following rules apply:

* If there is a delegation to an issue representative of the issue, then that is counted, otherwise

* The representative in the highest level node at or below the vote which have cast a vote.

Votes are counted using Condorcet Schulze method. There is a decision if there is a condorcet winner, and it is not the dummy alternative.

If there is a decision, and the node of the vote is not the designated node, then the proposal is introduced in the parent node, with the first maximum 3 alternatives above the dummy alternative with no compromise proposal (see below) based on them already on the palette. If this was an amendment to an existing proposal, then the alternatives are added.
