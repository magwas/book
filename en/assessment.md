# How the model meets the assessment criteria?

## Core Values

The distance of the judicial branch from the legislative branch, the special status of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and norm control ensures that basic human values are observed. Actually this control is just a failsafe, as the effect of Condorcet voting method is that the winning strategy for elected officials is to integrate views and and find meaningful compromises. This is the opposite of the winning strategy of most of the current plural voting methods. The winning strategy fundamentally influences political climate, in this case towards less extremities and more inclusivity.

Higher level of participation in political decision also tends to enhance political culture, as it is evidenced by by the Swiss example.

There is a perceived threat of democracy as the majority rule, according to which majorities will enslave minorities. Fortunately it does not seem to be the case if the ruling interest is sufficiently encompassing and rational. About the rationality see below in “Quality of decisions”.
