### Values and long-term strategy

Some of the authors of this paper argue that there should be a branch of power responsible for values and long-term strategic alignment, with the top-level official representing the unity, values and traditions of the organization with long minimum and no maximum term, or even with hereditary office. This branch should have mostly consultative, representative and some very limited, largely overridable veto powers. The idea of this branch is drawn from historic examples of modern european kingdoms, the office of Dalai Lama, and weak presidential systems.
