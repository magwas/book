### Local issues

The objective is to keep the growth potential and enhance execution experience by dealing with political issues. (As opposed to technocratic issues of the previous phase.)

Goals:

1. Momentum: win three local issues

2. Rules: Legislation is wetted and amended based on actual combat experience. The rules can be formally modeled and without self-contradiction.

3. IT: Support for basic procedures in a way most people are able to use it

Temporary measures:

* The monthly membership fee is 1% of the mean salary for the country the member lives in.
