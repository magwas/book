### The roadmap

We assume here that there is no external help is received to build the structure. In case of help, some of the following steps can be shortened. 

A more or less incremental approach is desirable because rules and parameters need fine-tuning, and introducing a global governance system is a very high risk task (as evidenced by our current one), so it must be confirmed that it actually works(as opposed to the current one).

The implementation is done in phases focusing on different goals. The goals are related to obtaining political momentum, tuning the rules, and implementing IT support for the procedures. These goals are interrelated, so just paying membership for a lot of people without sponsoring IT development or making sure that the current rules are adequate for governance is a bad idea of helping the growth.

In the initial phases there are temporary measures to compensate for lack of resources and sophistication. The temporary measures are lifted when meaningful. For example the member citizens will  pay 1% of the countryâ€™s average income until the whole country is covered and from then on the payment will be a state obligation to maintain the system

The envisioned phases are the following:
