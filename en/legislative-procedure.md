## Legislative Procedure

## Legislations

Each node have its own legislation, in the usual hierarchy: Legislation of nodes in higher level are binding for rules and decisions made on lower levels.
As legislation includes the rules of decision-making and the structure itself, everything can be changed as the need arises. To make sure that basic values are not violated and there is a possibility to recover from bad changes, there are two immutable legislations related to the top level node:
The Universal Declaration Of Human Rights should overrule any other legislation
Rules of decision making and related to the structure can always be overridden by a Debian Standard Resolution Procedure with the minimum number of sponsors being sqrt(n) and discussion period being ceiling(ln(n)) weeks, where  n is the number of people under the node.
