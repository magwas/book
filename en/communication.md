## Communication

As we have seen, communication is the key. The challenge is to provide relevant, high quality information within the comprehension of the individual, where this ability itself vary widely among people. The relevance requirement also means that everyone should have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the communication, whereas the quality requirement means that offtopic or even just excessive amount of information should not be allowed. Well, these are conflicting requirements.

The good news is that in ideal sized groups we can count on our naturally evolved skills to come up with a reasonably good balance.

In metagroups, the official communication is made by the officials and issue representatives of the metagroup, and as a result of the formal decision-making procedure of a node directly below. A form of communication is a non-binding vote, where the one communicating is free to name the alternatives, but the dummy alternative must present.

Informal nodes owned by formal nodes must work transparently, all financial transactions and all documents which do no contain sensitive data are being public and searchable by all individuals having the same eligibility as the eligibility requirements of the owner node. This rule is recursive: nodes under or owned by owned nodes should also adhere to it.

Representatives are expected to have over the average communication and negotiation skills, as they are selected to the task by people based exactly on these skills.

The approach to formal communication is that it is categorised based on the initiator and the properties of the issue at hand, and each individual can select which categories they choose to receive on which device. There is of course also a choice of what to actually overview. Categories could include

* notifications about different phases of the decision making process in nodes (a notable example being decision making process initiation directly in a metagroup by an individual),

* all or topic-specific official communication of nodes or representatives,

* communications related to a specific decision-making process,

* messages from individuals, further subdivided based on friendship or membership

* financial transactions filtered on initiating and receiving entity and amount

* documents issued by owned nodes, filtered by office and type

* for representatives based on whether the individual is represented, and whether it actually delegates the representative

    The above formal communication is augmented with the ability to comment every information in the system, including proposals, alternatives, financial transactions and documents. Comments are organised in threads and can only be deleted by the commenter, but can be up- and downvoted and flagged by different aspects (like offtopic, inadequate language, etc), and individuals can choose which comments to show and how, based on this information.

    All of the information in the system (down to individual comments) can be cross-referenced.
