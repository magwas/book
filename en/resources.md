## Resources and Financing

As we have seen, at higher nodes - for increasingly global problems - it becomes relatively easier to draw in resources, given that the political will (of the people, which is quite different from the political will of todayâ€™s high officials) is present.

The financial setup - with salaries aligned with responsibilities - makes it probable that positions are filled with talented individuals who will not feel the need to supplement their salary through other means. Their career path makes probable that genuine support of other people - rather than money - will put them to their positions.

The membership fee is a percentage of personal income. Taxes are voted for by the people, and can be progressive. This ensures that incomes are gathered in an equitable manner.

There are some not straightforward possibilities in the model. An unexplored possibility is to delegate some resources along with the budget to a lower node. For example if a grassroots initiative to rethink global peacekeeping approach would reach a certain momentum (e.g. to one or two layers below the root node), a decision on the top node could allocate the budget to the node and the peacekeeping forces to its executive branch, along with policies to follow. After that the members under the node would overview the peacekeeping operations and the implementation of the transformation. This allows also for those dissenting the change to gather under the node and influence decisions.
