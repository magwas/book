## The solution

Dunbarâ€™s findings can be analysed from an information theory standpoint. This analysis tells us that ensuring proper information flow is the key, formal procedures are needed, and information technology is an indispensable part of the solution.

  
The unique, new idea of our proposal is to form a hierarchical structure with ideally sized groups of people, with the structure and procedures ensuring that the signal-to-noise ratio remains low \(so everyone involved can participate in decisions in an informed manner\), and democratic values \(ability to participate, equal rights\) are observed.

  
While the underlying ideas and main properties of the model are quite clear and simple, the reader might find the model quite elaborate in places. This is because we tried to come up with solutions for each problems identified, and the problem space is quite complex.

  
Control of decisions is in the hand of people, while anyone can decide on the level of participation and amount of information received, based on personal preferences, abilities and the severity of situation.
