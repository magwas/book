# Key individuals and offices

The key goals in designing the role of key individuals and offices were the following:

* Avoid concentration of power
* Key posts should be filled in by individuals with high probability of having the necessary skills and expertise for the job
* The motivation of the key individuals should primarily be towards the mission of the office

  
Therefore we propose a system, where:

* Branches of power are separated. We propose to use at least legislative, executive, judicial and auditory branches. This adds the auditory branch to the classic trias politica, as procedural accountability is the way to ensure efficient operations throughout the organisation.
* While procedural accountability cares for operational efficiency, strategic alignment is achieved by indirectly controlling branches through legislation and election of top official. Institutional integrity is protected by minimal terms for top officials and by fact that legislative branch can only set rules and goals \(what, opposed to how\) for other branches, which is in turn controlled by the judicial branch.
* The motivation of key individuals is ensured by financial ways \(see 1.5 Finance\), and by the fact that they are indeed accountable to the legislative branch.
* Expertise of key individuals and a level of independency is achieved by minimum qualification \(with the exception of legislative branch\), and a career path where experience in lower levels is necessary to be elected as a higher level official. This also brings stability to the system as a whole.
