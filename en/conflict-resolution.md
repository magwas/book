## Conflict resolution

This part is about resolving disagreements about concrete cases, as opposed to policy issues. Basically this is the responsibility of the judiciary branch. 

The responsibility of the judiciary branch is to apply existing policies and established facts to a concrete case, and decide between competing interpretations of them. This results in either fully or partially accepting one of the interpretations, or sometimes ruling that the case is out of the jurisdiction.

In lower levels, there is no requirement to have a separate judiciary branch: having one is the matter of decision of the group. In case of no judge, the matter is decided by vote in the group. This is arguably not ideal (as resting this responsibility on the executive leader, as the other option would neither be), but in case of bad decision parties have the option to appeal the decision.

The basic rules are those which are already established in most legal systems: the initiator of the case have the burden of proof (unless laws say otherwise), and any party can appeal to a higher level court. In our system the highel level court is the judiciary branch of the metagroup containing the group where the ruling has been made. Judges should decline a case if they have any stake in the case.

In order to protect the judiciary branch from effects that would make their decisions subjective, only the leader of the judiciary is elected, and candidates should meet certain criteria. In higher levels this criteria includes experience in the judiciary, while in lower levels the "wisdom" score of the communication system is a good candidate to base the selection on.

The performance of judges is based on the number of decisions made in a given period (throughput), and the proportion of decisions overturned or confirmed in higher levels (quality). The salary of judges should be based on clear rules primarily based on quality and secondarily based on throughput. Establishing these rules is within the decision competence of the judiciary branch. Assignment of cases to judges should be done by clear rules, where human decision plays as little role as possible.

In criminal cases, the prosecuted person have the right to presumption of innocence, to expert defense and the right to any and all information related to the case.

Other rules are subject to policy decisions of the community. Nevertheless here are some recommendations:

* In some groups of cases it is okay to mandate to go through some conflict resolution procedures before the case can be formally raised. This can considerably ease the burden on the legal system.
* It is generally okay for a judge to accept the agreement of the parties on settling the cases (even in a criminal case). This can lead to solutions which are more effective in remediation and better help to understand the harm done. However the following conditions should apply:
  * The settlement is proportional to the damages, and 
  * The legal consequences are clear; the questions of who is right and why is established
  * In case of criminal cases the restorative measure makes it probable that both the affected individual will not repeat the crime, and others are deterred from similar crimes
* In case of economic players, the damages paid make conducting the harmful behaviour uneconomical
* In case of complicated set of actions (e.g. a corruption/malpractice/misappropriation case) where the responsibility cannot unambigously be pointed out, the responsibility of the deeds should be fully allocated on the guilty parties.
* In case of jury-judge settings, the jury candidates filtered out for possible biases should have an opportunity to testify, to avoid cases where [all people familiar with the problem domain are eliminated from the case](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/02/record-labels-want-to-ask-potential-jurors-do-you-read-ars-technica/)
* Parties bringing in others to legal proceedings should be responsible for the costs and inconvenience incurred in case they loose the case. The lack of such policy in the US legal system is a major cause of existence of patent trolls.
