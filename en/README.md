# Abstract

## The problem

Global challenges are hard to solve, because the decision-making mechanisms are not adequate for today’s tasks from the ground up. The root of the problem is that Homo Sapiens have evolved through the millions of years as an animal which lives in small herds. Our communication and social skills are optimized for that group size, and we perform rather suboptimally in groups which have sizes orders of magnitudes larger, like cities, countries or federations of states.

This leads to bad decision making and individuals in key positions motivated to screw up large quantities of other people. In this structure there are positive feedback loops between political and economic power. Income inequality is but a relatively benign sign of this. Positive feedback loops are leading to resonance catastrophe which destroys the structure which is hosting the process.

There are a couple of theoretical advances in the last two millennia, which were not seen as relevant, practicable or desirable by those who were setting up today’s decision-making structures and procedures. We have just put those theoretical advances together, analyzed the problem, and came up with a solution which hopes to answer all of the challenges identified.
