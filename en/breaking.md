### Breaking the power feedback loop

One of the (or maybe the single most important) fundamental problems of politics is that economical power generates political power which is in turn generates economical power. This is a positive feedback loop, fundamentally and badly affecting effectiveness of the whole political system now. This is why damping is discussed here.

* The ability to control and access to information ensures that key individuals are motivated to do exactly what their mandate dictates.

* The same ability of control and the fact that people are continously participating in political decisionmaking means that people in overall have more ability to understand political issues and the implications of their decisions.

* The career path of representatives brings stability to the system.

* The information flow in the system makes it resistant to disinformation and propaganda.

* The separation of powers makes it hard to capture the government.

Do not be mistaken: some level of economic imbalance is helpful, as that is the driver for most of the people to improve themselves. The authors of this paper do like the feeling of being rich. We just do not fancy to be in the middle of a resonance catastrophe.
