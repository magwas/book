## General Security

The international security problems of today stem from two kinds of problems:

1. Poverty and bad government causes uncertainty in people’s life. This is sometimes aggravated by global external factors, like global financial crises and climate change.

2. Disproportionate lobbying power of certain industries \(typically defence and oil\)

See  the rest of this paper for details on how bad government is fixed.

Poverty is the result of power inequalities, so it is the same than \#2, just in the conflict zone, not at the aggressor’s side.

\#2 is caused by the positive feedback loop between political and economic power, which has been discussed earlier.

The above in itself should make armed conflicts rare or nonexistent, as the root causes are addressed.

We have also seen earlier that for global problems it is comparatively easy to raise resources in this system once the political will of people is there. Armed conflicts do upset most of the people when they hear about them, even those who have no stake in them. So it can be argued that probably there will be political will to set up global peacekeeping forces which are truly independent from nation states, and also that policies would probably emphasize non-aggressive approach to conflicts \(like targeted humanitarian aid to tackle root causes, and catalysing peaceful discussion between parties\).

Also, introducing effective group decision making techniques makes previously antagonistic problems solvable. Solutions can be worked out in the system presented here by people affected by the conflicts at all sides. Once such solutions exist, it is very hard for leaders to continue the conflict, and more so when they face independent peacekeeping forces dedicated to enforce them.
