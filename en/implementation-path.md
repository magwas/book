## Implementation path
### The bootstrapping problem

Please note that in the first and second phase the structure provides only a low level of selective incentives, which in itself probably not enough to sustain growth. This is basically the same problem what Participatory Budgeting (PB) is facing: to provide enough level of incentives, the system should gain enough resources, but this is only possible over a certain size, where it can become embedded in the local governance. Proponents of PB used to put the problem as “the political will of the government is essential to start a PB process”. We however would like to draw attention to the following other possibilities:

* When already enough incentive exists, this structure can provide a way to more easily achieve the goals. So this structure - once the IT support exists - could be a choice for NGOs, neighbourhoods or other organisations as a democratic decision-making platform.

* With well-aimed external help, an incentive structure might be created to “bootstrap” the organisation artificially.

* As ideological drive and social bonds are strong motivators, a group of people organized along the common goal of “changing the world for the better good” might be able to put through the organization in the first stages. Admittedly this is a rather idealistic approach, we just list this option to show our naivety ;)

The single most important stumbling stone of the system is its need for an elaborate IT support. The Community Digital Tools Foundation is working toward these goals, but with the current level of funding it will take approximately a decade to build it.
