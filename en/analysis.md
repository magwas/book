# Analysis and theoretical background

This part (as actually the rest of the text) is a work in progress. [Comments are welcome](https://github.com/magwas/book/issues)

This is really just a draft, and will be reorganized and expanded in the future.

## Why politics sucks?

Current global challenges can be tracked back to a couple of factors. The most important ones are the following:

* inadequacy of decision making procedures
  * problems with plural voting system
    * incentivizes politicians to spread hatred and fear, and to lie to achieve it
    * incentivizes voters to lie (a.k.a. tactical voting)
    * reshapes the ideological landscape to contain two extremist camps
    * therefore its results have nothing to do with the organic will of the constituency
    * it is also not conductive in filtering out corrupt politicians
* positive feedback loop between economy and politics
* the motivation structure for officials is not pointing towards the office's mission
* the size of constituencies makes it impossible to figure out (and hence represent) the will of people due to abysmal signal/noise ratio


## How politics sucks?

To better understand the problem, let's see a couple of examples.

### Climate change

Climate change is caused by humanity emitting too much CO2 into the atmosphere. We are aware of the problem for quite some time.

The first research claiming climate change have probably appeared in or around 1950. 

The scientific community is probably aware of the problem since 1975, when Wallace Smith Broecker published an influental scientific paper on the topic, [Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?"](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/189/4201/460)

In 1988 a U.S. senate hearing sparked worldwide interest in the topic. NASA climate scientist James Hansen's testimony concluded that "[Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming.](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b5127807&view=1up&seq=50)"

The 1992 [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) clearly marks that at that point politicians were fully aware of the possible consequences of climate change.

Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence, not much happened: [there was an international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions, which was not ratified by some of the biggest emitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol#Ratification_process).

Meanwhile influental politicians have openly questioned the related scientific consensus, and in a lot of communities it is viewed as a matter of preferences as opposed to a matter of facts.

The "climate-deniers'" argumentation can be clearly tracked back to [the lobbying effort of "Big Oil" companies](https://influencemap.org/report/How-Big-Oil-Continues-to-Oppose-the-Paris-Agreement-38212275958aa21196dae3b76220bddc).

This kind of stance of politicians is of course results in policies which are beneficial to "Big Oil": the resistance against economical incentives to minimize emissions (carbon tax, emission exchange), to create a conductive framework to build up green energy generation and storage ( real-time electricity exchange available for end users is not even on the political agenda yet), wars knocking out the competition and resulting in higher prices, and utter subsidies towards emitting industries.

This is an example of the positive feedback loop between economy and politics; big economic players influence politics and the public opinion which in turn increases the capital concentration of those players, which in turn enables them to put more resources to lobbying.

The inability of politics to introduce effective measures against climate change is not just because the feedback loop mentioned above (yet). It is established that common people do regard climate change a serious existential threat even in spite the lobbying efforts. So the next question is: why politics do not follow the [clearly existing will of people](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1615/environment.aspx)?

The answer is quite complex, but in summary we can say that the current political system is not adequate to turn the will of people to executed policies, even in such a well-established case like climate change. This is caused by the inability of representative democracy to actually represent people's will, the very serious (and unfortunately not widely known) problems with the plural voting system, and the badly evolved motivation structure of officials in all branches of power.

(more examples to follow)


## The power feedback loop

### Theoretical background

A [positive feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback#Systemic_risk) is a loop between two components of a system where increase of output of the first component increases the output of the other component and that increase in turn increases the output of the other component. In lack of dampening effects it results in exponential growth of output, and ultimately destroys the system. This destruction of the system is called resonance catastrophe, referring to the [mechanical subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_resonance#Resonance_disaster) of this effect.

For those not familiar with dynamic system analysis the term "resonance catastrophe" could be confusing; the reason in layman's terms is that the "increasing output" can be something much more complicated than a simple value always increasing: for example in case of the mechanical case the amplitude of the vibration is increasing, while the phase of the outputs of different components lock to each other. However on the level of differential equations the [collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)#Collapse) is similar to the collapse of a stock market. Therefore we will use the term "resonance catastrophe' even when there is no evidence of any vibration-like process in the system.

An important factor of a positive feedback loop is that the system constantly accumulates energy. We can view a resonance catastrophe as an event which is triggered by the fact that the system contains more energy than it is able to contain. This helps to understand why those events are proceeding in relatively short timeframes (like an explosion). When we analyse non-physical systems, the energy is often not measured in Joules: it can be money, the level of frustration or even things like voter turnaround or activist's dedication.

In an economical analysis, the role of energy is often played by money. This means that there are cases when an increasing concentration of money is a sign of an impending resonance catastrophe. And this is why some thinkers incorrectly assume that all inequalities are bad. The problem with this extrapolation is that lack of differences in energy level means that there are no movements in the system: such a system is dead, providing no incentives for its compnents (in an economic system that means people) to do anything useful. In conclusion: some levels of inequality is necessary to make progress, but too much inequality might be a sign of an impending resonance catastrophe, which is best to be handled before something bad happens. The right level is a balance between speed of progress and risk of resonance catastrophe; which is arguably a value choice, so the consensus is probably between the extremes.

### The loop (Friedman's oversight)

Let's consider an economic component (in simplified terms, a company), and a political component (a decision maker or a decision making body). When the company is able to influence the decision maker to make decisions which disproportionately prefers the company, we have a problem.
In the immediate level it disrupts the free market; other players will be discriminated and more importantly the "invisible hand" (the market forces driving back the system to equilibrium) start to work less effectively. This is a problem in itself, resulting in more loss to the society than the sum of the gain for its individual components (again, we are talking about living people here). 

This disproportionate preference also means that the preferred company have more resources, and using more resources it can more easily influence decision makers to make decisions which prefers it even more. Leading to even more resources and even more disproportionate preferences. This is clearly a positive feedback loop.

The bottom line is that protecting the free market also means protecting politics from market influences. How can it be done, and to what extent?

#### Dampening the loop

When we try to mitigate the risk of this feedback loop, first we should think about what kind of capital concentration is harmless, and what is a sign of a feedback loop. Because there are multiple decision making levels, it is a hard question. 
There are amounts of money with which one can (and some did) buy a house, a village, a city, or a country. On the other hand investing in a housing project, a wind farm, a fleet of container boats, or a satellite constellation can be a legitimate investment which requires the same (or even much higher) amount of money. This would lead one to believe that limiting capital concentration - which is an obvious way to limit ability to influence politics - is futile.  However limited capital concentration is adequate for a lot of industries, where small, fast-moving companies are actually more efficient than even the current unit sizes. In other industries the price of higher concentration can be an increased oversight, which can take a lot of forms, from increased reporting requirements to even dedicated people or offices responsible to the political realm. The related rules could even be formulated in a way which is dependent on capital concentration and independent of industry.

When we try to understand a system, the first thing is to have adequate data on it. Movement and accumulation of money is a clear candidate here, especially money spent on influencing politics.

When we are talking about influencing politics, money spent on direct lobbying is just a drop in the ocean (and even this is only monitored in the most advanced democracies). A good example is the [SLS scandal](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/what-is-going-on-with-nasas-space-launch-system-rocket/) and [Sen. Shelby's campaign contributions](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/contributors?cid=N00009920&cycle=2020&type=C): The direct amount spent on lobbying is such small compared to the stolen taxpayer money that probably there are other incentives exist. (Keeping jobs for otherwise bright and hard working people in a very unproductive system is surely one of those). In other examples [criminal levels of corruption are well-documented](https://english.atlatszo.hu/). 

But even the most advanced and transparent democracies cannot monitor their own companies because of complete lack of transparency of some offshore locations.

The above-mentioned possible policies are more part of the economic setup than the political one, and should be subject to policy decisions (as opposed to be part of the system itself), hence documented here. The systemic components are documented throughout the system description, and [summarized here](breaking.md).

## Motivational structure

Politicians used to have a fixed salary, without any incentives to actually listen to the constituency. Which is in itself a mission impossible in the current system (see the next section).

In many cases that salary is much lower than that of a CEO of a company with a comparable responsibility. This in one hand means that people who would actually be able to handle the associated challenges are more probably choose a position outside politics, and in the other hand it means that politicians will concentrate on other (sometimes plain illegal) activities. And [a president's involvement in growing weed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-09/marijuana-allegations-brings-call-for-probe-into-serb-president) is far less detrimental than [corruption](https://hungarytoday.hu/croatia-court-finds-mol-chief-hernadi-guilty-on-corruption-charges/) which is a logical way to make money for a politician, with a lot of temptation generated by unscrupulous companies.

Rules for party finance are varying by country, but generally they also incentivize politicians to listen to economic interests instead of their constituency, and in a lot of cases make non-elected party members dominate the elected representatives simply by their ability to decide on who gets the campaign money - hence get elected.

The time period of mandate artificially limits the event horizon of politicians, making them unmotivated to handle strategic issues.

## Constituency size

Humans have evolved to work most efficiently in groups of a couple of ten individuals. This fact is reflected by the notion of [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number). The constituency of an elected official is usually more magnitudes larger than that.

From the [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) perspective, individuals in a discussion can be modeled as a combination of a sender, a listener and an information processing unit. Noise can be anything which is not understandable of interesting for the individual, because

* bad physical quality (too low volume, bad characters, etc)
* below the expected quality (bad grammar, bad rhetoric)
* beyond the individual's expertise
* beyond the individual's ability to process (due to sheer volume)
* not interesting due to its topic

A constituency can be viewed as a single channel with the constituents and the representative participationg in it.


With the increasing number (and hence diversity) of individuals on a given channel, the amount of noise is growing fast: if we have one listener (the representative) and the others as senders, it is linear. If we assume real discussion with everyone as both sender and listener, it is exponential.

If we just consider the processing ability, we can understand the magnitude of the problem with the following example:

Let's assume that at 50 participants (a non-unreasonable assumption for Dunbar's number), an average individual is saturated ad 50% (a conservative estimate given the definition of Dunbar's number). If the amount of information to process grows linearly with the number of individuals, at 50.000 participants the individual is saturated at 50000%, that is there are 500 times more information comes in than the individual is able to process. Of course this is a very rough estimate, not accounting for the other individual's inability to participate in the discussion for the same reason, and a lot of other factors, like the fact that with real discussion we have an exponential growth, not a linear one.

An obvious solution for the problem is to partition the channel to more smaller ones, and implement some kind of noise filter between them. An obvious challenge to use such a structure as a basis for high quality decision making, which is democratic (bottom-up).
Most of the described model is concerned with that: the structure, the process and the communication rules.

## Voting

We use voting for choosing the right people for an office and decide on policy questions. Another - and more important for the analysis of useability for a particular goal - distinction is that we either decide on a single candidate (a seat or policy question), or multiple candidates (like the composition of a decision making body). Those are single seat and multiple seat election methods respectively. When we decide on multiple seats, a naive approach is to use multiple single-seat elections to compose the decision-making body, by partitioning the voters into smaller groups; electorates. If we imagine a set of electorates where 49% of people vote for a candidate with agenda A, and 51% vote for candidate with agenda B, we will immediately see the problem with this approach: agenda B will have all the seats, while agenda A - which represents nearly half of the voters - will not have a representation; this kind of election system is not proportional. Let's call this the "single-seat problem". A common way to solve this problem is to combine single-seat election with another, where the voters choose one party, and the seats allocated in proportion to the votes for the different parties.

Voting is a decision making method. The ideal way of decision making would minimize the [Bayesian regret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_regret) the sum of bad feelings about the outcome of the vote among all voters.

Today in politics we almost exclusively use the plural voting system: voters choose one choice from a small, closed set of choices. It have the drawback that it drastically reduces information: voters are usually have different degrees of preference towards the different candidates. That contains much more information than what is actually sampled in a plural vote.

The implications of this are not well understood even among researchers of politology: there are a lot of theories which use the assumption that plural voting is the only imaginable voting method, 
hence a lot of researchers of the area are confined within the small, tortured world view influenced by the consequences of plural voting.

The game theoretical convequences of the plural single-seat voting system are the following:

* The winning strategy of the candidate is to
  * [position themselves into the extremes](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111465?seq=1) and
  * incite fear and hatred, especially towards those candidates which are positioned close to her
* The winning strategy of the voter is to lie about their preferences (a.k.a. tactical voting)
* There are two incumbent parties which have real chance to get elected, and new entrants have little chance to gain more strength, therefore
* There is no way for the voters to filter out corrupt candidates.

As we have seen, we measure voters' preferences using a sampling method with a huge information loss, and (an increasing number of) voters actually lie in votes, which in itself questions the accuracy of the outcome of the vote.
And as political players not just adapt to, but (through inciting fear and hatred) actively shape the public opinion, it can be argued that even the public opinion itself is different from the opinion the voters would organically have.

Fortunately there are other voting systems, with better qualities. There are [a couple of measures which can be applied to voting systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_electoral_systems).

An important rule about those properties is [Arrow's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem). this basically says that there is no voting method satisfying all of the following criteria:
* If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
* If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).
* There is no "dictator": no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group's preference.
However Arrow's theorem assumes that voter's preferences can be non-transitive: there are cases that candidate A is preferred over candidate B preferred over candidate C, which is in turn preferred over candidate C. This is called [Condorcet paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox). Although [Condorcet paradox did already happen](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/brexit-condorcet/), it can be argued that such a case is in most cases the result of bad decision preparation: if the decision space is adequately explored and the voters can adequately explore the consequences of the alternatives, such a situation is more a theoretical possibility than a real problem.

The [Condorcet method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) is a preferential (which means that voters can give an ordering of their preferences) single-seat method, minimizing Bayesian regret.
It have the following properties:
* the winning strategy for the candidate is to position themselves to the median of voter preferences by integrating different world views 
* the winning strategy for the voter is to be honest about their preferences
* corrupt candidates can be filtered out by the voters

Voting methods in general result not just in the winning candidate, but also yield a measure for the ordered group preference of the voters. That can be used to identify a small set of generally preferred candidates, which is useful for noise filtering purposes when the goal is to find the preference of a partitioned electorate without the single-seat problem.

There is a [proportional version of Condorcet vote](https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/proportional.html) which is a multi-seat preferential method designed to satisfy important voting criteria, based on Condorcet method.
While we are not aware of any formal analysis of its adherence to voting criteria or its game-theory consequences, its similarity to Condorcet suggests that it have similar properties. Therefore we use it in our model for multiple-seat elections until scientific results suggesting the use of another method are available.

Another design consideration related to voting is that in some cases some individuals are not interested in a given topic, or do not feel that they have a well-grounded opinion. We use some [liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy) component to allow limited delegation of vote to cater for those cases.

## The whole decision making process

Voting is but a step of a decision making process. First of all, there should be some ways to actually come up with the alternatives on the ballot. 

From the information theory perspective, the decision preparation - leading to a ballot - and the decision-making itself (voting) are two distinct phases with different communication needs.

Voting works on a limited set of information, and very formal, hence easily scaleable to any size of constituency, provided the IT support is available.

Decision preparation however is inherently a deliberative process, subject to quickly deteriorating noise/signal ratio with the increase of the electorate size. The ideal size of deliberative activities is probably Dunbar's number.


An important consideration here is [procedural equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_justice), which in this case means that every voter should have equal opportunities to put alternatives to the ballot. 
Another consideration is [information inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide): the fact that different players have different amount of information on matters, which influences their perception of the consequences of different decision alternatives.
Information inequality can be viewed as a subset of [other constraints related to information availability and decision making quality](http://innovbfa.viabloga.com/files/Herbert_Simon___theories_of_bounded_rationality___1972.pdf).
An obvious solution to itigate these information availability related problems is to create a decision-making process which leaves enough opportunities to explore the decision space, and helps voters by preparing information relevant to the decision in an easily processable form. As in many cases, quality can be ensured by making sure that participants compete along rules where the winning strategy is to achieve the objectives of the procedure.
This means that the decision making procedure should have a well-formalized process, which also have room for deliberation which is inherently an informal (and sometimes chaotic) process.

An already existing, well-designed decision making procedure providing procedural equality is the [debian standard resolution procedure](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution#item-A). As it is designed to work with an unpartitioned electorate, it can be used as a basic building block for decision-making, but needs some generalizations to use in our model.

The strategy used in the model is that deliberation is started in Dunbar-sized groups, using the Debian resolution procedure, the identified alternatives are iteratively refined (both in terms of quality of supporting information and by integrating similar alternatives) in higher decision-making levels,  while voting is always done by the whole concerned constituency.

In the assesment part there are [some more considerations](quality-of-decisions.md) documented related to the quality of decision-making.
