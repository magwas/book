###Informal structure, executive organisations

The above part described the formal structure. All nodes in the formal structure must adhere to the rules described in this document. There is also an alternative tree, where all the rules of the formal structure are optional, and decisions are only binding to members of the subtree where the decisions were made, so people are free to try out solutions outside the current system parameters of the time.
Nodes in the informal structure do not participate in the formal decision making process (but individual members can initiate decisions in  their formal groups based on needs arising there).
Nodes of the formal structure can own nodes of the informal structure. This allows to build non-democratic organisations, like offices and companies to support the democratic organizations, while giving them all the tools in case they are needed.
