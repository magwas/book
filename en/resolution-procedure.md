### Resolution procedure

The resolution procedure is an adapted version of the Debian Standard Resolution procedure. A proposal starts either in a group as a grassroots initiative, or in a metagroup by a representative. There is a designated node above to the initiating node. (For example someone can initiate a change of air traffic laws to allow flying broomstick without permit in the flight club.) The proposal bubbles up in the tree, discussed, possibly amended with alternative choices and voted upon in each discussion. (For example it is discussed in the flight club association, the association of motor sports, the sport association and in the state level, while the association of sailors add an amendment of the original wording in the sport association node to ban broomsticks above lakes, and based on the initiation of someone in a local neighbourhood, an alternative is raised to ban flying broomsticks altogether.)
The vote in each node is conducted among all who belong to the subtree of the node, and there is always a dummy alternative “the choices below are unacceptable” in order to cover the whole decision space, and provide a way to signal the boundaries of acceptability.
A successful vote - where there is a Condorcet winner, and it is not the dummy alternative - is needed for the proposal to bubble up, and become a decision in the designated node.
As we go up in the tree, the discussion periods get longer, to allow for amendments to catch up with the original proposal.
