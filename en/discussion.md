#### Discussion

A proposal is in discussion initiation for at least Dm and at most DM days \(e.g. 14 and 28\).

  
The representatives of the node can ask for lengthening the period, and call to end it.

  
This is the time provided for amendments of the original proposal to be created in the node's subtree.

  
If there is an amendment of the original proposal is in progress anywhere in the subtree, then another amendment to the same can be initiated in any node where the expected time for reaching the target node is less than equal than that of the existing amending proposal, using Dm as the estimated discussion initiation period length.

  
In the discussion period, the representatives of the issue and the node, and the elected officials should create a document for each alternatives, containing the following:

* Short, space-limited summary of the alternative, with possible links to longer explanations.
* The lists of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats related to the alternative

  
The document should contain a consensus. Where consensus cannot be reached, minority opinions should be noted.
