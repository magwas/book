### Effectiveness

The implementation of decisions is the responsibility of the executive branch. No big structural changes here, though the effectiveness of the implementation is ensured by the following measures:

* The measures reducing corruption \(see accountability and transparency\) make execution more effective. \(Referring again to the i[mportance of process accountability](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103106000898).\)

* As the salary of executive leaders is very competitive, there is a chance that individuals with the right skillset will compete for those positions.

* The separation of powers means that the executive branch is free to choose the way of implementation within the goals, budget and legal framework provided by legislative branch

* A responsibility of auditory branch is to assess the results and effectiveness of the execution, and the legislative branch decides on goal and budget structure and whether new leadership is needed partly on this assessment. So there is a feedback loop both towards the executive branch about quality of execution, and towards legislative branch about the desirable environment for smooth execution. Citizen feedback helps to identify hot spots, transparency ensures that the feedback is honest, and separation of duties makes sure that there is no hidden agenda behind assessment programme structure or emphasised points of the reports.
