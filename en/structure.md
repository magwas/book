#Description of the model

##Structure

The basic structure is a tree containing ideally sized groups (around Dunbar’s number) of people as leaves, and the degree of other nodes (“metagroups”) are also in the ideal range. Nodes of the structure can (but not necessarily) be civil organisations, local, country level or international governing bodies. Those nodes can be associated with the resources managed (e.g. city, country), and membership of their subtree can be limited by membership/citizenship/etc. Otherwise members and groups are free to move around in the structure along some rules, and the structure reacts to those movements to ensure properties which in turn provide good communication and reasonable decision times.
