#### Proposal

A proposal is issued on the official channel of the node, with a designated node where it will be effective.
The designated node can be the same node where the proposal is issued, or any of its ancestors.
In groups, any member of the group can issue a proposal at any time.
In metagroups, there are two ways to issue a proposal:
Representatives of the metagroup can issue it at any time
As a result of successful vote in a child node at the end of the voting period
The one proposing an alternative becomes the issue representative for that alternative, and expected to participate debates and prepare documents related to the issue as long as the alternative is still considered.
