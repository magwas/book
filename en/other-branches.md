### Other branches

Organizing nodes also have one elected official for each of the other branches of power.  They include at least the following: executive, judicial and auditory.

  
There is a minimal and maximal term associated to each type of the elected officials.

  
For each of the offices there are minimum qualifications for the elected official. These qualifications should be chosen in a way which makes it probable that the individual have the needed expertise, but makes it possible to find more candidates considered by the members to fit the office. For example only judges can be elected to be official of the judicial branch.  
In higher level nodes experience in the same office in a lower level is also required.
