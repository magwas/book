## Accountability and Transparency

Transparency is handled by mandating that all deliverables of all processes be public to all concerned individuals. The ability to comment and cross-reference provides short feedback loops and a basis to initiate more formal remedial procedures.

Accountability is handled in two ways.

1. Process accountability is handled partly with the informal ways provided by the transparency measures, and partly by designating the auditory branch of power to actively guard for it.

2. Strategic and motivational accountability is ensured by directly electing top officials of each branch of power.
